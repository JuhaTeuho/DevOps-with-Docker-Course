1. Tried with following command and inputed "helsinki.fi"

docker run -it ubuntu sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

2. Found out that curl was not installed, so following commands needed to be executed:

docker run -it ubuntu
apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl 
sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

3. Then inputting "helsinki.fi" brought the desired result.
